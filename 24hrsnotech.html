        <h1 id="hours">My Experience With 24 Hours of No Technology</h1>
        <div class="rant">
            <p>Going 24 hours without technology was a very liberating experience, and it has only strengthened my desire to go full luddite. For the past few months, I have already been cutting down my screen time, so this challenge wasn’t as difficult for me as it would have been say last year. 
            </p>
            <p id="ultitle">Some changes I’ve made to reduce my screen time include:</p>
            <ul class="improvements">
                <li>Deleting all social media</li>
                <li>Only using my phone for its productive functions as well as communication with a select few people</li>
                <li>Turning off all nonessential notifications</li>
                <li>Setting all my devices to greyscale and turning on “reduce motion” (the idea here is to make the device as boring as possible)</li>
                <li>Not using any screens at least an hour before bed (replaced with reading) and not looking at my phone when I wake up</li>
                <li>Leaving my phone in the other room or at least not in my pocket</li>
                <li>Turning my ringer off and reinforcing the idea in my mind that I don’t have to respond to every notification I get, the second I get it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most effective things for me have been not using my phone before bed and using greyscale. The former has significantly improved my quality of sleep and energy levels throughout the day. The latter makes looking at my phone feel really depressing and is a good reminder of its manipulative nature. Turning color back on now feels like an attack on my eyes and brain. The more I disconnect, the more I begin to detest all this technology that has insinuated itself into every crack and crevice of my life.
            </p>

            <p>There’s almost nothing I do that does not require me to be on my computer. On average, I probably spend at least eight hours a day on my laptop. It’s completely exhausting, and it seems like there’s no way out. I’ve begun looking for ways to complete schoolwork without the use of a screen, but so far all I’ve been able to come up with is printing out my readings. I now do all my readings from paper before bed, and even this small change has both increased my motivation to read and my reading stamina. I am currently considering purchasing an e-ink external monitor (the screen that’s used on a paperwhite Kindle) to use with my laptop in order to combat the screen fatigue I’m experiencing.</p>

            <p>When I woke up today, rather than reaching for my phone first-thing, I just laid there and thought. Throughout the day, I did a lot more thinking than I ever do. It resulted in the birth of so many ideas that would have never existed otherwise. I think I only laid in bed for 10 minutes before getting up and starting my day. It felt so good to know that I hadn’t wasted any of my day on my phone right off the bat. I then went on a run around my neighborhood and made myself breakfast afterward, which is a rare occurrence. I wanted to make sure I was still productive, so I printed out some reading materials beforehand and spent most of the day reading, brainstorming, and planning. I made sure to take periodic breaks to walk around outside, which helped reset my perception and fight cabin fever. Overall I had significantly more energy today, and everything I was doing felt so much more healthy and natural. It was a breath of fresh air to not feel the constant fatigue and brain fog caused by screens. I plan to continue to think of more ways I can eliminate screen time from my life.</p>
