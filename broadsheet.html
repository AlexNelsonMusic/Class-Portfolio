                <h3>by Lawrence Abrams <time datetime="2022-12-15">Oct. 9, 2024</time></h3>
    
                <p>Internet Archive's "The Wayback Machine" has suffered a data breach after a threat actor compromised the website and stole a user authentication         database containing 31 million unique records.</p>
                    
                <p>News of the breach began circulating Wednesday afternoon after visitors to archive.org began seeing a JavaScript alert created by the hacker, stating that the Internet Archive was breached.</p>
                    
                <p>"Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!," reads a <a href="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/d/data-breaches/w/wayback-machine/js-alert.jpg">JavaScript alert</a> shown on the compromised archive.org site.</p>
    
                <p>The text "HIBP" refers to is the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">Have I Been Pwned</a> data breach notification service created by Troy Hunt, with whom threat actors commonly share stolen data to be added to the service.</p>
    
                <p>Hunt told BleepingComputer that the threat actor shared the Internet Archive's authentication database nine days ago and it is a 6.4GB SQL file named "ia_users.sql." The database contains authentication information for registered members, including their email addresses, screen names, password change timestamps, Bcrypt-hashed passwords, and other internal data.</p>
                    
               <p>The most recent timestamp on the stolen records is September 28th, 2024, likely when the database was stolen.</p>
                    
                <p>Hunt says there are 31 million unique email addresses in the database, with many subscribed to the HIBP data breach notification service. The data will soon be added to HIBP, allowing users to enter their email and confirm if their data was exposed in this breach.</p>
                    
                <p>The data was confirmed to be real after Hunt contacted users listed in the databases, including cybersecurity researcher <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/">Scott Helme</a>, who permitted BleepingComputer to share his exposed record.</p>
                    
                <p class="code"><code>9887370, internetarchive@scotthelme.co.uk,$2a$10$Bho2e2ptPnFRJyJKIn5Bi ehIDiEwhjfMZFVRM9fRCarKXkemA3PxuScottHelme,2020-06-25,2020-06-25,inter netarchive@scotthelme.co.uk,2020-06-25 13:22:52.7608520,\N0\N\N@scotthelme\N\N\N</code></p>
    
                <p>Helme confirmed that the bcrypt-hashed password in the data record matched the brcrypt-hashed password stored in his password manager. He also confirmed that the timestamp in the database record matched the date when he last changed the password in his <a href="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/d/data-breaches/w/wayback-machine/helme-password-entry.jpg">password manager</a>.</p>
    
                <p>Hunt says he contacted the Internet Archive three days ago and began a disclosure process, stating that the data would be loaded into the service in 72 hours, but he has not heard back since.</p>
    
                <p>It is not known how the threat actors breached the Internet Archive and if any other data was stolen.</p>
    
                <p>Earlier today, the Internet Archive suffered a DDoS attack, which has now been claimed by the BlackMeta hacktivist group, <a href="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/d/data-breaches/w/wayback-machine/tweet.jpg">who says they will be conducting additional attacks</a>.</p>
    
                <p>BleepingComputer contacted the Internet Archive with questions about the attack, but no response was immediately available.</p>

            <h2>What Twitter Does to Our Sense of Time</h2>

            <div id="twomgn">
                <h3>by Jenny Odell <time datetime="2022-12-15">Dec. 8, 2022</time></h3>
    
                <p>The past few weeks, watching people weigh alternatives to Twitter, I've been reminded of a moment that occurs in every episode of “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo.” She makes her clients put every piece of clothing they own into a giant (often horrifying) pile before going through it, holding and addressing each garment individually. Although Kondo is sometimes written off as a minimalist who tells you to get rid of everything, to me, her work has more to do with intention and cultivating meaningful ties to the things you have. Clients on the show often end up reckoning with their identities — who they are and who they want to be— and with fundamental shifts they've been too scared or busy to take on. For Kondo, to arrange your things is to arrange your best self and your idea of the good life.</p>
    
                <p>This lesson from offline spaces can be applied to digital habits, especially the ones that shape our experience of time. Which digital rhythms are we actively following because they make us feel good, and which are we entrained to? Entrainment, a term that originated in biology and then spread to the social sciences, refers to the alignment of an organism's physiology or behavior with a cycle; the most familiar example would be our circadian rhythm. The signal driving entrainment, in this case light and dark, is called a “zeitgeber” (German for “time giver”).</p>
    
                <p>The concept of entrainment points to the ways in which our experience of time can be affected by so much more than the number of hours we have in a day. The Taiwanese performance artist Tehching Hsieh demonstrated an extreme example of this with “Time Clock Piece (One Year Performance 1980-1981),” in which he punched a time card and took a photo of himself every hour on the hour for a year. Although Hsieh imposed this entrainment on himself, any commuter who leaves home before dawn or any assistant who fits her activities into the patterns and preferences of her boss recognizes the sense that even our “free” time is not really free if we are constantly thinking about it. To be entrained to the activities of people or institutions often means that they have power over us, compelling us to rush, wait or both.</p>
    
                <p>Something like entrainment seems to be at work in our relationship to Twitter and other forms of social media. The rate of updates and notifications provides a powerful zeitgeber— one that can even override our circadian rhythm, as any nighttime scroller knows. I first became aware of the depth of my entrainment after the 2016 election and again at the beginning of the pandemic. It seemed that the more I used these platforms, the more I got psychologically adjusted to a certain social frame rate — one that happened to be ticking by with constant developments and quickly evolving outrage. It was as if opening my phone revealed a stream of time running much faster than the one in the room where I sat.</p> 
    
                <p>The resulting shift in my sense of time had a range of effects. I found it harder to pay attention to other events and processes that took longer or played out less sensationally even if I cared about them — like the local effects of climate change, grass-roots housing campaigns or even just the details of friends' lives. I felt like my thoughts were running on shorter loops or never getting completed. Even my breaths were short, as though a full inhale couldn't fit into such tiny intervals, and my joints would ache from a state of constant anticipation. It was the feeling of a furrowed brow, applied to my entire body. Most haunting was a sense that I had no substance, and that the physical world, with all its minute fluctuations and gradual changes, was somehow losing its color and texture.</p>
    
                <p>In the past few years, in part because of how frayed my mind felt, I started avoiding my Twitter and Instagram feeds altogether. From this remove, I sat down and wrote out on paper what it was that I really wanted from these platforms. The answer ended up being a sense of recognition among peers, connection to people with shared interests and whose work I admire and the ability to encounter new, unexpected ideas. As opposed to algorithms, I wanted these new things to be recommended by individuals who had reasons to like them, like the weekly set on my local college radio station by a D.J. whose wide-ranging taste I'm at pains to describe, but reliably enjoy. Really, I think I just wanted everything to have a little more context.</p>
    
                <p>With this in mind, I slowly started piecing something else together — at the time, a mix of emails, group chats and RSS feeds. But finding more context often means going more slowly and as I did so, I was confronted by my old habits and expectations around time and pacing. Information no longer came in through one nonstop fire hose, and even though that was precisely what I had complained about, the change made me uncomfortable and dissatisfied. Was something missing? The management scholar Allen C. Bluedorn has written that patterns of entrainment can persist in an organization long after the original zeitgeber is gone, and this is a bit like what happened to me. Years of inhabiting a temporal attitude had left a deep indentation on my mind, as if I were waking up early for a job I no longer had.</p>
    
                <p>Over time, the indentation softened, and I got used to a different definition of what it meant to be connected. In the absence of the constant updates signs of other tempos began to enter the picture: the migratory ducks arriving in the lake nearby, the long email from a friend that only comes once every few months and requires my full attention, the unglamorous city council meeting, the long, historical arc of something just now cresting in the news. My breathing, eating, sleeping body felt more real, with more traction among the sensory minutiae of the everyday. I even felt I could see further in both directions: into my past with all its failures and triumphs, and into the future where I might do something as-yet unimaginable. But what I'm describing is not a linear progression or a once-and-for-all kind of story. Now and then, I get remagnetized to that old clock and have to remember to step away.</p>
    
                <p>Of course, not everyone is so lucky. Entrainment to tempos in work, health or child care aren't so much individual choices as they are reflections of power relationships, and many would require collective action or outside support to adjust. But for many of us, plugging into the pace of mainstream social media may not be as necessary as it feels. If the experience I've described sounds familiar to you, try stepping away. See if some of the things you originally came to social media looking for, including things you've never found, might be available through slower, less commercial channels, which have less of an incentive to suck you in.</p>
    
                <p>On Marie Kondo's show, besides the clothes-pile reckoning, there is another moment that happens in almost every episode. The clients, who have usually started out with a sense of dread or helplessness, surprise themselves by realizing that they're actually enjoying the process. Momentarily freed of old habits, they exhibit that elusive feeling of making hopeful and cleareyed decisions about how they want their own life to be. At the end of each episode, the transformed living space typically isn't something out of a high-end shelter magazine; it just looks like the space of someone who had time to think things through. The same can be true here: Letting go of one overwhelming rhythm, you invite the presence of others. Perhaps more important, you remember that the arrangement is yours to make.</p>

            <h2>Luddite Teens Don't Want Your Likes </h2>
            
            <div id="threept1">

                <h3>by Alex Vadukul <time datetime="2022-12-15">Dec. 15, 2022</time></h3>
                
                <p>On a brisk recent Sunday, a band of teenagers met on the steps of Central Library on Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn to start the weekly meeting of the Luddite Club, a high school group that promotes a lifestyle of self-liberation from social media and technology. As the dozen teens headed into Prospect Park, they hid away their iPhones — or, in the case of the most devout members, their flip phones, which some had decorated with stickers and nail polish.</p>
    
                <p>They marched up a hill toward their usual spot, a dirt mound located far from the park's crowds. Among them was Odille Zexter-Kaiser, a senior at Edward R. Murrow High School in Midwood, who trudged through leaves in Doc Martens and mismatched wool socks.</p>
    
                <p>“It's a little frowned on if someone doesn't show up,” Odille said. “We're here every Sunday, rain or shine, even snow. We don't keep in touch with each other, so you have to show up.”</p>
    
                <p>After the club members gathered logs to form a circle, they sat and withdrew into a bubble of serenity.</p>
    
                <p>Some drew in sketchbooks. Others painted with a watercolor kit. One of them closed their eyes to listen to the wind. Many read intently — the books in their satchels included Dostoevsky's “Crime and Punishment,” Art Spiegelman's “Maus II” and “The Consolation of Philosophy” by Boethius. The club members cite libertine writers like Hunter S. Thompson and Jack Kerouac as heroes, and they have a fondness for works condemning technology, like “Player Piano” by Kurt Vonnegut. Arthur, the bespectacled PBS aardvark, is their mascot.</p>
    
                <p>“Lots of us have read this book called 'Into the Wild,'” said Lola Shub, a senior at Essex Street Academy, referring to Jon Krakauer's 1996 nonfiction book about the nomad Chris McCandless, who died while trying to live off the land in the Alaskan wilderness. “We've all got this theory that we're not just meant to be confined to buildings and work. And that guy was experiencing life. Real life. Social media and phones are not real life.”</p>
    
                <p>“When I got my flip phone, things instantly changed,” Lola continued. “I started using my brain. It made me observe myself as a person. I've been trying to write a book, too. It's like 12 pages now.”</p>
    
                <p>Briefly, the club members discussed how the spreading of their Luddite gospel was going. Founded last year by another Murrow High School student, Logan Lane, the club is named after Ned Ludd, the folkloric 18th-century English textile worker who supposedly smashed up a mechanized loom, inspiring others to take up his name and riot against industrialization.</p>
    
                <p>“I just held the first successful Luddite meeting at Beacon,” said Biruk Watling, a senior at Beacon High School in Manhattan, who uses a green-painted flip phone with a picture of a Fugees-era Lauryn Hill pasted to it.</p>
    
                <p>“I hear there's talk of it spreading at Brooklyn Tech,” someone else said. A few members took a moment to extol the benefits of going Luddite.</p>
    
                <p>Jameson Butler, a student in a Black Flag T-shirt who was carving a piece of wood with a pocketknife, explained: “I've weeded out who I want to be friends with. Now it takes work for me to maintain friendships. Some reached out when I got off the iPhone and said, 'I don't like texting with you anymore because your texts are green.' That told me a lot.”</p>
    
                <p>Vee De La Cruz, who had a copy of “The Souls of Black Folk” by W.E.B. Du Bois, said: “You post something on social media, you don't get enough likes, then you don't feel good about yourself. That shouldn't have to happen to anyone. Being in this club reminds me we're all living on a floating rock and that it's all going to be OK.”</p>
    
                <p>A few days before the gathering, after the 3 p.m. dismissal at Murrow High School, a flood of students emerged from the building onto the street. Many of them were staring at their smartphones, but not Logan, the 17-year-old founder of the Luddite Club.</p>
    
                <p>Down the block from the school, she sat for an interview at a Chock full o'Nuts coffee shop. She wore a baggy corduroy jacket and quilted jeans that she had stitched herself using a Singer sewing machine.</p>
    
                <p>“We have trouble recruiting members,” she said, “but we don't really mind it. All of us have bonded over this unique cause. To be in the Luddite Club, there's a level of being a misfit to it.” She added: “But I wasn't always a Luddite, of course.”</p>
    
                <p>It all began during lockdown, she said, when her social media use took a troubling turn.</p>
    
                <p>“I became completely consumed,” she said. “I couldn't not post a good picture if I had one. And I had this online personality of, 'I don't care,' but I actually did. I was definitely still watching everything.”</p>
    
                <p>Eventually, too burned out to scroll past yet one more picture-perfect Instagram selfie, she deleted the app. “But that wasn't enough,” she said. “So I put my phone in a box.”</p>
    
                <p>For the first time, she experienced life in the city as a teenager without an iPhone. She borrowed novels from the library and read them alone in the park. She started admiring graffiti when she rode the subway, then fell in with some teens who taught her how to spray-paint in a freight train yard in Queens. And she began waking up without an alarm clock at 7 a.m., no longer falling asleep to the glow of her phone at midnight. Once, as she later wrote in a text titled the “Luddite Manifesto,” she fantasized about tossing her iPhone into the Gowanus Canal.</p>
    
                <p>While Logan's parents appreciated her metamorphosis, particularly that she was regularly coming home for dinner to recount her wanderings, they grew distressed that they couldn't check in on their daughter on a Friday night. And after she conveniently lost the smartphone they had asked her to take to Paris for a summer abroad program, they were distraught. Eventually, they insisted that she at least start carrying a flip phone</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="threept2">
                <p>“I still long to have no phone at all,” she said. “My parents are so addicted. My mom got on Twitter, and I've seen it tear her apart. But I guess I also like it, because I get to feel a little superior to them.”</p>
            
                <p>At an all-ages punk show, she met a teen with a flip phone, and they bonded over their worldview. “She was just a freshman, and I couldn't believe how well read she was,” Logan said. “We walked in the park with apple cider and doughnuts and shared our Luddite experiences. That was the first meeting of the Luddite Club.” This early compatriot, Jameson Butler, remains a member.</p>
    
                <p>When school was back in session, Logan began preaching her evangel in the fluorescent-lit halls of Murrow. First she convinced Odille to go Luddite. Then Max. Then Clem. She hung homemade posters recounting the tale of Ned Ludd onto corridors and classroom walls.</p>
    
                <p>At a club fair, her enlistment table remained quiet all day, but little by little the group began to grow. Today, the club has about 25 members, and the Murrow branch convenes at the school each Tuesday. It welcomes students who have yet to give up their iPhones, offering them the challenge of ignoring their devices for the hourlong meeting (lest they draw scowls from the die-hards). At the Sunday park gatherings, Luddites often set up hammocks to read in when the weather is nice.</p>
    
                <p>As Logan recounted the club's origin story over an almond croissant at the coffee shop, a new member, Julian, stopped in. Although he hadn't yet made the switch to a flip phone, he said he was already benefiting from the group's message. Then he ribbed Logan regarding a criticism one student had made about the club.</p>
                
                <p>“One kid said it's classist,” he said. “I think the club's nice, because I get a break from my phone, but I get their point. Some of us need technology to be included in society. Some of us need a phone.”</p>
    
                <p>“We get backlash,” Logan replied. “The argument I've heard is we're a bunch of rich kids and expecting everyone to drop their phones is privileged.”</p>
    
                <p>After Julian left, Logan admitted that she had wrestled with the matter and that the topic had spurred some heated debate among club members.</p>
    
                <p>“I was really discouraged when I heard the classist thing and almost ready to say goodbye to the club,” she said. “I talked to my adviser, though, and he told me most revolutions actually start with people from industrious backgrounds, like Che Guevara. We're not expecting everyone to have a flip phone. We just see a problem with mental health and screen use.”</p>
    
                <p>Logan needed to get home to meet with a tutor, so she headed to the subway. With the end of her senior year in sight, and the pressures of adulthood looming, she has also pondered what leaving high school might mean for her Luddite ways.</p>
    
                <p>“If now is the only time I get do this in my life, then I'm going to make it count,” she said. “But I really hope it won't end.”</p>
    
                <p>On a leafy street in Cobble Hill, she stepped into her family's townhouse, where she was greeted by a goldendoodle named Phoebe, and she rushed upstairs to her room. The décor reflected her interests: There were stacks of books, graffitied walls and, in addition to the sewing machine, a manual Royal typewriter and a Sony cassette player.</p>
    
                <p>In the living room downstairs, her father, Seth Lane, an executive who works in I.T., sat beside a fireplace and offered thoughts on his daughter's journey.</p>
    
                <p>“I'm proud of her and what the club represents,” he said. “But there's also the parent part of it, and we don't know where our kid is. You follow your kids now. You track them. It's a little Orwellian, I guess, but we're the helicopter parent generation. So when she got rid of the iPhone, that presented a problem for us, initially.”</p>
    
                <p>He'd heard about the Luddite Club's hand-wringing over questions of privilege.</p>
    
                <p>“Well, it's classist to make people need to have smartphones, too, right?” Mr. Lane said. “I think it's a great conversation they're having. There's no right answer.”</p>
    
                <p>A couple days later, as the Sunday meeting of the Luddite Club was coming to an end in Prospect Park, a few of the teens put away their sketchbooks and dog-eared paperbacks while others stomped out a tiny fire they had lit. It was the 17th birthday of Clementine Karlin- Pustilnik and, to celebrate, the club wanted to take her for dinner at a Thai restaurant on Fort Hamilton Parkway.</p>
    
                <p>Night was falling on the park as the teens walked in the cold and traded high school gossip. But a note of tension seemed to form in the air when the topic of college admissions came up. The club members exchanged updates about the schools they had applied to across the country. Odille reported getting into the State University of New York at Purchase.</p>
    
                <p>“You could totally start a Luddite Club there, I bet,” said Elena Scherer, a Murrow senior.</p>
    
                <p>Taking a shortcut, they headed down a lonely path that had no park lamps. Their talk livened when they discussed the poetry of Lewis Carroll, the piano compositions of Ravel and the evils of TikTok. Elena pointed at the night sky.</p>
    
                <p>“Look,” she said. “That's a waxing gibbous. That means it's going to get bigger.” As they marched through the dark, the only light glowing on their faces was that of the moon.</p>

                <p>We are tired of living in an online world where people are isolated from each other on boring, generic social networks that don't let us truly express ourselves.

                <p>That's where Neocities comes in. We provide a canvas for people to make any web site they want. Whether it be a web site about something they're good at, something they love, something they hate, or their own completely customized profile where they can introduce themselves in a way that actually matters to them.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Our goal: to enable you to harness the creativity, beauty, and power of creating your own web site. To rebuild the web we lost to automation and monotony, and make it fun again.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Neocities is just getting started, and we've got a lot of amazing things in store. I strongly believe that, with your help, we're really going to shake things up on the web. Thank you for believing in us (and yourselves).</p>
                
                <p>Long Live the Web!</p>

                <p>PS: What are you waiting for? <a href="https://neocities.org">Go make your web site!</a></p>
